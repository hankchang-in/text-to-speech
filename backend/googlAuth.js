const string = "On November 24, 1971. A normal Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Flight 305, a Boeing 727, prepared for a routine trip from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle, Washington. The passengers boarded, the engines roared, and at 2:50 PM, the plane took off.Among the passengers was a man who identified himself as Dan Cooper.He was ordinaryâ€”mid-40s, around six feet tall, wearing a dark suit, a black tie, and polished shoes. He carried a briefcase and a simple paper bag. No one paid him much attention.But within thirty minutes, he would become one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in FBI history."
const string1 = "Hello, everyone! Today, weâ€™re diving into one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in historyâ€”the case of a mysterious robber known as D.B. Cooper. Have you ever heard of him? Do you know what he did? If not, get ready, because this is a story filled with suspense, a daring hijack, and a vanishing act that has baffled the FBI for over 50 years. Letâ€™s unravel the mystery of D.B. Cooper!"
const string2 = "At 3:00 PM, Cooper handed a note to Florence Schaffner, a flight attendant.She absentmindedly slipped it into her pocket, assuming he was just another businessman trying to flirt.Then, Cooper leaned in and whispered, 'Miss, you better read that. I have a bomb.'Her hands trembled as she unfolded the note.'I have a bomb in my briefcase. You are being hijacked. Sit next to me.With a forced smile, she sat beside him. Cooper slowly opened his briefcase just enough for her to see red wires and cylindrical objectsâ€”it looked exactly like a bomb.He spoke calmly,Tell the captain: I want $200,000 in cash, four parachutes, and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle. No tricks, or Iâ€™ll blow this plane up.The message was relayed to the cockpit.The pilots immediately contacted Seattle-Tacoma Airport and the FBI.A hijack was in progress."
const string3 = "The FBI quickly assembled the ransom money and parachutes. They also alerted the media, who broadcasted the news nationwide. The FBI instructed the pilots to circle the Seattle airport until the demands were met. Cooper was calm and collected, sipping bourbon and soda, and even offered to pay for the drinks of the passengers. He seemed polite and non-threatening, but the crew knew better. They were dealing with a dangerous criminal who had just hijacked a plane.For the next two hours, Flight 305 circled Seattle, waiting for Cooperâ€™s demands to be fulfilled.Inside the plane, Cooper was strangely polite. He paid for his drinks, even offered to request meals for the crew. He never raised his voice, never acted nervous.At 5:39 PM, the plane landed in Seattle. The authorities delivered the ransom moneyâ€”a stack of unmarked $20 billsâ€”and the four parachutes.Cooper let the 36 passengers go, keeping only the pilots and a flight attendant.Then, he issued his next order: 'Refuel the plane'. Weâ€™re going to Mexico City."
const string4 = "The FBI was ready to comply with Cooperâ€™s demands. They refueled the plane, and the pilots prepared for takeoff. But Cooper had one more request: He wanted the plane to fly at a low altitude, under 10,000 feet, with the landing gear down and the wing flaps at 15 degrees. The pilots explained that this would be impossibleâ€”the plane would run out of fuel before reaching Mexico City. Cooper agreed to a compromise: They would fly to Mexico City, but with a stopover in Reno, Nevada. The plane took off at 7:40 PM, heading south. Cooper ordered the crew to stay in the cockpit, and the flight attendant to join them. He closed the door behind her, leaving him alone in the cabin.But somewhere over Washington, around 8:13 PM, the rear staircase light flashed on.It meant only one thing:ðŸšª Someone had opened the planeâ€™s rear stairway.The crew felt a sudden pressure change.D.B. Cooper was gone.Somewhere in the pitch-black sky, through the roaring winds, in the middle of a stormâ€¦He had jumped.With $200,000 strapped to his body.Into nowhere."    
"At 7:40 PM, the plane took off again.But Cooper had a very specific flight plan:Fly under 10,000 feet,Landing gear down ,Flaps set at 15 degrees ,Speedâ€”precisely 200 miles per hour.The pilots did as they were told, heading south."
const string5 = "and then vanishes mid-air into the stormy night. When the plane lands in Reno, authorities storm inâ€”but Cooper and the money are gone. What follows is one of the biggest manhunts in FBI history. Helicopters sweep the forests, agents comb through rugged terrain, and banks are put on high alert for the ransom bills. But for years, not a single clue emerges. Did Cooper survive? Experts say the jump was suicidalâ€”plunging into freezing darkness, dressed in nothing but a suit and loafers, over dense forests and mountains. And yet, in 1980, a boy stumbles upon a shocking discoveryâ€”three bundles of $20 bills buried along the Columbia River, matching Cooperâ€™s ransom money. Was this proof he perished, or a breadcrumb left behind by a man who outsmarted the entire FBI? Theories swirlâ€”was he an ex-military paratrooper? A ghost lost to the wilderness? Or did he escape and live a secret life? After 50 years, the truth remains missing. Did D.B. Cooper pull off the perfect crime, or did the night swallow him whole? Did he survive and outsmart the entire FBI?Or did he vanish, buried somewhere in the cold, dark wilderness?The truth? Still missing. What do you think?"
